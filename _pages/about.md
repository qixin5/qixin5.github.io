I am an Associate Professor at [School of Computer Science](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/) <img src="../images/whu.png" alt="whu" width="25" height="25" style="margin-right:0px;"> (WHU).
My research area is software engineering. I am broadly interested in developing automated and semi-automated approaches and techniques that make software development easier and improve software quality, security, and reliability. Recently, I have been working on problems related to automated program repair, software debugging, and program debloating.
I am a member of [Centre of Software Testing, Analysis and Reliability](http://cstar.whu.edu.cn/en/index.html) (CSTAR).
Before joining Wuhan University, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) <!--<img src="../images/gt.jpg" alt="Location" width="40" height="40" style="margin-right:0px;">--> working with Dr. [Alex Orso](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/orso/).
I received my Ph.D. from [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) <!--<img src="../images/brown.png" alt="Location" width="40" height="40" style="margin-right:0px;">-->, advised by Dr. [Steven Reiss](http://cs.brown.edu/~spr/).

> <img src="../images/attention.png" alt="Location" width="25" height="25" style="margin-right:5px;"> I'm looking for highly motivated students at both undergraduate and graduate levels to join my group. If you're interested, please contact me via `qxin AT whu DOT edu DOT cn`
